Number recognition with Pyhton
==============================

Description
-----------
This is a neural net, that can recognise hand-written numbers.

Features
--------
1. Large dataset comes with working neural net (unpack archive into the same folder).
2. Precision of recognition is more than 95%.

Planned features
----------------
1. Add menu, where parameters of neural net can be changed.
2. Add saving and loading most effective model.
3. **(Not sure)** Add ability to test the net with your own written numbers (either downloaded from image or written right into the app).

User guide
----------
1. Clone the repository and move into it`s directory
* `git clone https://github.com/sanchouz12/Number-recognition`
* `cd ./Number-recognition`
2. Install all needed dependencies (it's better to install into virtual environment)
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. To start training and testing neural net launch app.py
* `python app.py`
