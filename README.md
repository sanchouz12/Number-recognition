Number recognition with Pyhton
==============================

Description
-----------
This is a neural net, that can recognise hand-written numbers. To train uses MNIST dataset.

Features
--------
1. Large dataset comes with working neural net (unpack archive into the same folder).
2. Precision of recognition is more than 95%.
3. You can change parameters of the net: amount of hidden layers and neurons in it, learning coefficient
4. You can save and load main parameters and weights from file.

User guide
----------
1. Clone the repository and move into it`s directory
* `git clone https://github.com/sanchouz12/Number-recognition`
* `cd ./Number-recognition`
2. Install all needed dependencies (it's better to install into virtual environment)
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. To start training and testing neural net launch app.py
* `python app.py`
